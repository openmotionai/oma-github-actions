# OMA GitHub Actions

A collection of reusable GitHub Actions for AI-powered development workflows.

## ü§ñ Claude Code Review Action

Get intelligent code reviews and automated fixes from Claude 4 Sonnet by simply commenting on your pull requests. Claude can both review code and create fix PRs with proposed changes.

### ‚ö° Quick Start

Add this workflow to your repository at `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: Claude Code Review

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  claude-review:
    if: |
      github.event_name == 'pull_request' ||
      (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && github.event.issue.pull_request &&
       (contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude') || contains(github.event.comment.body, '@Claude')))
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: openmotionai/oma-github-actions/actions/claude-code-review@main
      with:
        anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### üîë Setup

1. **Get Anthropic API Key**:
   - Sign up at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) if you don't have an account
   - Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
   - Create a new API key

2. **Add to Repository Secrets**:
   ```bash
   # Using GitHub CLI
   gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --body "your-api-key-here"
   
   # Or via web interface:
   # Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret
   ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

**GitHub Issues Support**: An attempt was made (June 2025) to extend Claude reviewer functionality to standalone GitHub issues for planning discussions, but this implementation was reverted due to:
- Workflow failures and instability
- Complex event handling conflicts between issues and PRs
- ToolUseBlock formatting issues in responses

The current version only supports:
- Pull request reviews (automatic on PR creation/updates)
- PR comment triggers (using `@claude` mentions in PR comments)

For planning discussions, continue to use PRs or consider alternative approaches.

### üöÄ Usage

Comment on any PR with Claude commands:

**Review Mode** (analysis only):
- `@claude review this code`
- `@claude check for security issues`
- `@claude analyze the logic in main.py`

**Propose Changes Mode** (suggests improvements):
- `@claude fix the bug in error handling`
- `@claude refactor this function for clarity`
- `@claude optimize the database queries`
- `@claude add error handling to the API calls`

### üí∞ Cost

- Uses Claude 4 Sonnet: ~$3 input / $15 output per million tokens
- Typical PR review: $0.10-$0.50 depending on code size
- Only charges when you use it (no monthly fees)

## üîÆ Future Directions

Based on research into AI code modification architectures in 2025, we've identified key improvements for automated code fixes:

‚Ä¢ **Direct File Modification Architecture**: Move away from tool calling patterns to direct file modification approaches similar to Aider and Cursor IDE, which parse AI responses for changes and apply them programmatically rather than relying on AI tool calling for file operations

‚Ä¢ **MCP Integration for Local Development**: Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for local development workflows, enabling real file system access and more reliable code modifications when working outside GitHub Actions constraints

‚Ä¢ **Diff-Based Change Application**: Adopt diff-based approaches for more reliable file modifications, especially for large files, using git patch mechanisms rather than full file replacement to reduce conflicts and improve merge reliability

### GitHub Issues Support - Next Steps

For future attempts to implement GitHub Issues support for planning discussions:

‚Ä¢ **Simplified Event Handling**: Focus on a single event type (issue_comment) rather than mixing issues, issue_comment, and pull_request events to reduce complexity

‚Ä¢ **Separate Workflow Files**: Create dedicated workflows for issues vs PRs to avoid conditional logic conflicts

‚Ä¢ **Response Formatting**: Investigate and fix ToolUseBlock formatting issues that caused raw tool output to appear in comments instead of formatted responses

‚Ä¢ **Alternative Approaches**: Consider using GitHub Discussions API or dedicated planning tools rather than trying to extend PR-focused workflows to standalone issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Actions

| Action | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `claude-code-review` | AI-powered code review and analysis with Claude 4 Sonnet | ‚úÖ Available |

**Note**: Automated code fix PRs are currently in development. The action provides comprehensive code analysis and suggestions, with automated fix implementation planned for future releases.
